    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some of the detection algorithms are ready to implemented on the
            drones.
        \item YOLO trends to have the lower accuracy to detect the small and
            overlap of the object comparing with RCNN, while the RCNN runs much
            slower than YOLO.
        \item The software environment and the communication of the M300 and
            YunGuan2 are tested in the past 1 week.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The next step to implement the aforementioned methods, and use the
            metrics to reproduce the basic algorithm as well as their derivates:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Implement the YOLO and some simple navigation algorithm on
                    the M300.
                \item Change the detection with Linhan's algorithm.
                \item Prepare for the flight test.
