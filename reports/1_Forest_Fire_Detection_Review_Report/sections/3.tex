    Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator}}

    A fire detection drone system is developed which can be separated into 3
    parts:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Autopilot Design}: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Hardware choosing and design(embeded system design)
                \item Flight control algorithm design and implementation:
                    \linebreak
                    Including the state estimation, control and waypoint
                    navigation.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Ground Control Station designing and implementation
        \item \textbf{Simulation software design and implementation}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Dynamic model implementation
                \item Data communication designing
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \colorbox{orange}{Ideas:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The detecting methods could be improved.
        \item Processing the images on the on-board computer instead of the
            Autopilot.
    \end{itemize}
