        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{A automatic concrete damage detection framework
                    is proposed by developing and modifying the Mask-RCNN, which
                    is developed for the instance
                segmentation. }
            \item deconvolution is implemented to improve the accuracy.
        \end{itemize}
