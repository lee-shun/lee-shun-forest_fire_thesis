    \begin{itemize}
        \item The remote sensing problem can be classified into 3 types
            according to the platforms:
        \item Both traditional and deep learning-based methods are already
            applied on the aforementioned 3 platforms.
        \item One stage model and multi-stage models are both often used these
            days. One-stage model are faster, but tends to achieve lower
            accuracy.

        \item The next step to implement the aforementioned methods, and use the
            metrics to reproduce the basic algorithm as well as their derivates:

            From easy to hard:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Color space
                \item Mask R-CNN
                \item CNN-LSTM
                \item SSD
                \item YOLO
                \item* Transformer
